# Spec Candidates

**Pipeline**: `.claude/ideas/future_ideas.md` (raw, unconfirmed ideas) → **this file** (confirmed
worth a real spec eventually, not yet written) → a real spec exists, tracked in `ROADMAP.md`'s
"Specced, coming soon" table → implemented, row moves to "Delivered" → `CHANGELOG.md` (shipped).

A running backlog of ideas confirmed worth a real EARS spec eventually, but not yet written or
scheduled. Distinct from `ROADMAP.md`, which only tracks specs that already exist (written, with
real acceptance criteria) — this file is the layer *before* that.

**Maintenance rule**: when a candidate here actually gets spec'd (via the `ears-spec` skill), move
it out of this file and into `ROADMAP.md`'s "Specced, coming soon" section as part of that same
change — don't leave it duplicated in both places. Before adding a new candidate or touching this
file, re-check existing entries against the current codebase — referenced classes/components may
have moved.

## Candidates

*(empty)*

The V1–V5 roadmap in `.claude/HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md` §3 already lists the major themes and user
stories (US-001 through US-018) with acceptance criteria at the epic level — those are the initial
source of truth for what to spec next, not duplicated here. Use this file for ideas that come up
*during* implementation and are confirmed worth building but don't map cleanly onto an existing
roadmap item (e.g. a UX refinement discovered while building the weekly grid, a cross-cutting
tooling need). Don't pre-populate it from the roadmap — that would just be restating
`HIGH_LEVEL_DESIGN.md`.
